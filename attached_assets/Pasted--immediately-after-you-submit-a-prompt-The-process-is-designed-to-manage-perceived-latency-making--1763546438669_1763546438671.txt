 immediately after you submit a prompt.The process is designed to manage "perceived latency"—making the wait for the AI feel shorter than it actually is.1. The Submission & TransitionThe moment you hit Enter or click the Send icon, several UI state changes happen simultaneously to confirm the action:Input Clearance: The text you typed vanishes from the input box.Message Relocation: Your text is instantly rendered as a "bubble" or distinct block in the chat history area (usually right-aligned or visually distinct from the AI's voice).Control Shift: The "Send" button typically transforms into a "Stop" (square) icon. This signals that a process is active and gives you the agency to abort it.2. The "Thinking" State (Latency Management)Before the first word appears, there is a delay (latency) while the server processes the request. The UI must indicate that the system hasn't frozen.Loaders: You will usually see a visual placeholder where the AI answer will be. Common patterns include:Pulsing Dots: Three dots (...) animating.Shimmer/Skeleton: A gray bar with a moving gradient that simulates text loading.Spinner: A rotating circle near the AI's avatar.3. The "Typewriter" Effect (Token Streaming)This is the signature UI behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of the whole answer appearing at once (like a standard web page load), it flows in piece by piece.Streaming: Text appears rapidly, usually word-by-word or "token-by-token." This mimics human typing but at a superhuman speed.The Cursor: Often, a blinking cursor or a solid block is rendered at the very end of the generating text to draw your eye to the current action.Auto-Scroll: As the text expands vertically, the viewport automatically scrolls down to keep the newest text visible. Note: Good UI logic usually disables this auto-scroll if you manually scroll up to read previous text.4. Dynamic FormattingAs the stream arrives, the UI interprets Markdown or code on the fly:Text Styles: **Bold** or *Italic* text often renders instantly as the tokens arrive.Code Blocks: If you asked for code, the UI detects the backticks (```) and suddenly wraps the incoming text in a distinct dark-mode block with syntax highlighting (coloring variables and functions).5. Completion & Post-ProcessingOnce the AI sends the "End of Sequence" signal, the UI finalizes the interaction:Cleanup: The blinking cursor disappears. The "Stop" button reverts to the "Send" or "Microphone" icon.Tool Injection: A generic toolbar appears below the completed message. This typically includes:Copy to clipboard.Regenerate (redo).Feedback (Thumbs up/down).Input Focus: The cursor focus is returned to the text input box, inviting you to start the next turn of the conversation.Summary of StatesPhaseVisual IndicatorUser InteractionSubmissionInput clears, message moves up.User waits.ThinkingPulsing dots or skeleton loader.Can click "Stop".StreamingText flows in, screen scrolls.Can read while loading.CompletionFormatting finalizes, icons appear.Can Copy, Edit, or Reply.
