High level requirements:

Add server side telemetry for each prompt event: prompt_created, board_generated, board_page_created, board_downloaded, error_occurred, user_feedback_submitted.

Persist analytics in a Prompts table and a PromptEvents table.

Compute daily, weekly, and monthly aggregates. Include topic level insights and conversion rates (prompt → board, board → download).

Create an Admin Overview dashboard with filters at the top: Date range, Topic, User, Model, Language, Output format. Default to Last 30 days.

Show KPI cards: Total prompts, Unique users, Boards generated, Pages created, Downloads, Success rate, Avg pages per board, Avg time from prompt to first board. Each KPI must reflect active filters.

Show time series charts for Prompts, Boards, and Downloads over time.

Show Top topics table with: Topic, Prompts, Boards, Conversion rate, Avg pages per board, Last used.

Show Prompt quality insights: average prompt length, common tokens, stop words removed count, language distribution, average generation latency, error rate.

Show Funnel chart: Prompt created → Board generated → Downloaded, with conversion percentages and drop off counts.

Show Cohort table by prompt week: retention of users who return to create another prompt within 7, 14, and 30 days.

Provide a Details table with the most recent 100 prompts, with columns: Timestamp, User, Topic, Prompt excerpt, Board id, Pages, Downloaded yes/no, Latency ms, Status. Each row links to a prompt detail drawer with full prompt, parameters, and event log.

Add export buttons for CSV for the Details table and for Top topics.

Respect RBAC: only users with role admin can view this page. Return 403 for others.

Privacy: store only what the app already stores for prompts. If prompts may contain PII, mask before persisting analytics_prompt_excerpt. Keep full text only if policy allows.

Performance: all charts must load within 2 seconds for 100k events. Add database indexes to support filters.

SLP-focused insights: Include metrics that are clinically relevant for Speech-Language Pathologists, for example:

Most frequent communication topics used by clients (e.g. daily routines, feelings, school, play).

Distribution of board structures (average number of pages, symbols per page, navigation depth) to evaluate ease of use.

Language complexity (average word length, phrase vs single word usage) to help track progression in expressive language.

Error types or abandoned prompts to identify communication breakdowns.

Prompt-to-usefulness ratio (how many generated boards are actively downloaded or used) to highlight what supports communication best in therapy contexts.
